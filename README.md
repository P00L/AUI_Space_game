# A Space game
AUI - Polimi 2015-16

We developed a game, set in the universe, to be used in the “Magic Room” in the therapeutic centre L’Abilità, using a wide range of technologies that we’ll explain in a following section.
The child attention will be focused mainly on the lights appearing on a luminous carpet: in fact, the goal of the game is to avoid the asteroids displayed running towards the kid, or pick different light logic blocks, simply walking on them (as you can see in the images below).
On a screen a funny kid mascot helps the child telling him/her the actions that (s)he has to do.
The atmosphere of the game changes according to the action of the child, because a reinforcement will be executed to let the child know when (s)he’s done a good work, filling the room with colors.
Since every child has his/her own disabilities, the game is thought to be fully customizable by the therapist: (s)he has the opportunity to configure each game, choosing which actions the child will do.
